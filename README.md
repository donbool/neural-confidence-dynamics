# Emergent Confidence and Context-Dependent Dynamics in Noisy Recurrent Neural Systems
simulates a neuroscience-inspired context-switching decision task using a noisy RNN, and analyze whether confidence and task-relevant structure emerge in internal neural-like dynamics, especially under realistic noise and context changes.
