# emergent confidence and context-dependent dynamics in noisy recurrent neural systems
simulates a biologically-inspired context-switching decision task using a noisy RNN, and analyze whether confidence and task-relevant structure emerge in internal neural-like dynamics, especially under realistic noise and context changes.
