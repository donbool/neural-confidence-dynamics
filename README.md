# emergent confidence and context-dependent dynamics in noisy recurrent neural systems


this project simulates a context-dependent decision-making task using a noisy recurrent neural network (RNN), designed to explore how confidence-like signals and dynamic representations emerge from internal neural activity under structured noise. by mimicking key features of biological decision-making, including context switches, stimulus ambiguity, and trial-to-trial variability, the model serves as a computational experiment aligned with principles from systems and cognitive neuroscience.
